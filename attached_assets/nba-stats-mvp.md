# NBA Player Performance Predictor – Project Specification & Execution Plan

## 🎯 Purpose
A data-driven application that fetches NBA player statistics and models **regression-to-mean** behavior using both descriptive statistics and probabilistic analysis.  
The goal is to estimate the **cool-off probability** (inverse-likelihood of repeating high performances) across points, assists, rebounds, and 3-pointers — adjusted for player career phase, seasonal normalization, and fatigue/load effects.

---

## 🧱 Core Functional Modules

### 1. Player Search
- Autocomplete search using `balldontlie.io` API  
- Display: **Name**, **Team**, **Position**, **Height**, **Weight**  
- On select:
  - Fetch season averages  
  - Fetch last 5 games  
  - Load career data for weighting model

### 2. Season Statistics
Displays per-game season metrics:
- **PPG**, **RPG**, **APG**, **FG%**, **3P%**, **FT%**, **MPG**, **Minutes Played**
- Includes z-score normalization against league averages

### 3. Player Comparison
- Dual-player comparison layout  
- Interactive bar charts for **PTS**, **REB**, **AST**, **FG%**, **3P%**  
- Overlay of inverse-likelihood “cool-off” probability curves

### 4. Recent Game Performance
- Line chart for last 5 games showing **points**, **rebounds**, **assists**, and **minutes played**  
- Tooltips with detailed game stats  
- Dynamic updates on player/season change

### 5. Inverse-Frequency Probability Model

**Core Formula:**
\[
P_{inv}(x) = 1 - f(x), \quad f(x) = \frac{1}{N}\sum I[\text{stat}_i ≥ t]
\]

**Adjustments:**
1. **Career Phase Weighting**
   - Early → rising trend (recent seasons weighted higher)  
   - Peak → stable mean (balanced weighting)  
   - Late → decline (stronger exponential decay)  
   \[
   w_i = e^{-λ (T - t_i)}
   \]

2. **Seasonal Normalization (z-score)**
   \[
   z = \frac{x - μ_{season}}{σ_{season}}
   \]

3. **Dynamic Player Thresholds**
   \[
   \text{thresholds} = \{μ, μ+σ, μ+2σ, μ+3σ\}
   \]

4. **Fatigue / Load Curve**
   - Rolling 10-game mean vs long-term mean  
   - If current > mean +1σ → regression likelihood ↑

5. **Injury / Minutes-Played Filter**
   - Declining minutes = lower sustain probability

6. **Non-Stationarity Handling**
   - Recency weighting keeps responsiveness while retaining long-term variance

---

## 📊 Statistical Thresholds
| Category | Thresholds |
|-----------|-------------|
| Points | 10, 15, 20 |
| Rebounds | 4, 6, 8, 10 |
| Assists | 4, 6, 8, 10 |
| 3-Pointers | 2, 3, 5 |

Each threshold:
- Computes **frequency**, **inverse-likelihood**, and **weighted inverse-likelihood**
- Visualized in grouped bar charts per stat

---

## 📈 Visualization
1. **Frequency vs Inverse-Likelihood Bar Charts** – For PTS, REB, AST, 3PM  
2. **Career-Adjusted Cool-Off Curve** – Regression probability by player phase  
3. **Dual Comparison Dashboard** – Side-by-side player view  
4. **Fatigue Curve** – Rolling vs historical mean (minutes & output)

## 🧠 Modeling Rules
\[
\hat{p}_{\ge t} = \frac{1}{N}\sum I[x_i \ge t], \quad q_{\ge t} = 1 - \hat{p}_{\ge t}
\]
Weighted version:
\[
w_i = α^{N-i}, \quad \hat{p}^{(w)} = \sum w_i I[x_i \ge t], \quad q^{(w)} = 1 - \hat{p}^{(w)}
\]
Career-phase weighting:
\[
w_i = e^{-λ (T - t_i)}, \quad λ_{early} < λ_{peak} < λ_{late}
\]
Z-score normalization:
\[
z = \frac{x - μ_{season}}{σ_{season}}
\]

---

## ✅ Testing Checklist
- Player not found → handled  
- Small N → stable output  
- α = 1 → unweighted results  
- α < 1 → recent games emphasized  
- Output written to `_analysis.json`

---

## 🧪 Notebook
`notebooks/exploration.ipynb`: visualize inverse vs frequency and validate trends.

---

## 🗂 Cursor Rule
```
Always read nba-stats-mvp.md before coding.
Document CLI flags, formulas, and assumptions.
Update when model logic or API data structure changes or Update documentation after major features
Frontend only starts after CLI validation.
```

   - Shows informative messages:
     - "✅ Using **last 3 games** against **LAL** (found 5 total)"
     - "✅ Using **2 game(s)** against **BOS**" (if fewer than 3)
   - All prediction models respect the filter:
     - Inverse-frequency probabilities
     - Career phase weighting (if enabled)
     - Bayesian smoothing
     - Confidence levels

4. **Smart Handling:**
   - Warning if no games found against opponent
   - Falls back to all games if insufficient data
   - Works with career phase decay toggle
   - Respects custom thresholds from Advanced Settings

**How It Works:**
```python
# Extract opponents from recent games
for game in recent_games:
    home_team = game['game']['home_team']
    visitor_team = game['game']['visitor_team']
    # Determine which is opponent based on player's team

# Filter games against selected opponent
opponent_games = [g for g in games if opponent_matches(g, selected_team)]

# Sort by date and take only last 3 games
opponent_games.sort(key=lambda x: x['game']['date'], reverse=True)
filtered_games = opponent_games[:3]  # Most recent 3 matchups

# Use filtered games for all predictions
games_df = pd.DataFrame(filtered_games)
probability_results = model.calculate_inverse_frequency_probabilities(
    games_df, thresholds, alpha=alpha
)
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `app.py` (lines 1137-1169)
- Text input field with placeholder and help text
- Extracts opponents from history as helpful reference
- Accepts any team abbreviation (not limited to history)
- Filters games by comparing home/visitor team IDs
- Sorts by date (most recent first) using `sort(key=lambda x: x['game']['date'], reverse=True)`
- Takes only last 3 games: `opponent_games[:3]`
- Updates `games_df` to use `filtered_recent_games`
- All downstream predictions automatically use filtered data

**Use Cases:**
- **Pre-game Analysis:** "How does LeBron perform against the Warriors?"
- **Betting Strategy:** Compare predictions vs specific matchups
- **Matchup Advantages:** Identify favorable/unfavorable opponents
- **Context-Aware Predictions:** Account for defensive matchups

**Example Workflow:**
1. Load player (e.g., LeBron James)
2. Toggle "🏀 Filter by Opponent" ON
3. Type "GSW" in the text input field
4. Predictions automatically recalculate using games vs Warriors
5. Compare with toggle OFF to see general predictions
6. Can enter ANY team abbreviation (even if not in history)

**Impact:**
- ✅ Matchup-specific prediction accuracy
- ✅ More informed betting decisions
- ✅ Identifies opponent-specific patterns
- ✅ Complements existing prediction models
- ✅ No interference when disabled - optional enhancement

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- No games vs opponent → Warning + fallback to all games
- Insufficient games (<3) → Uses available data with Bayesian smoothing
- No opponent data in API → Graceful degradation, feature disabled
- Multiple games vs same opponent → All included in analysis

### Team Lookup API Integration ✨ NEW (October 18, 2025)
**Fixed Opponent Detection Issue:**
- Resolved "vs N/A" bug where opponent teams weren't displaying
- Implemented centralized team lookup system

**The Problem:**
- balldontlie API's `/stats` endpoint returns `home_team_id` and `visitor_team_id` but NOT team abbreviations
- Cached data didn't include team information
- Previous logic tried to extract team data from nested objects (which were empty)

**The Solution:**
1. **Team Lookup Cache (`nba_api.py`)**:
   ```python
   def get_teams(self) -> Dict[int, str]:
       """
       Fetch all NBA teams and create ID → abbreviation mapping
       Returns: {1: 'ATL', 2: 'BOS', 5: 'LAL', ...}
       Cached in self._teams_cache for performance
       """
   ```

2. **Opponent Detection Logic**:
   ```python
   # Get team IDs from game data
   home_team_id = game['game']['home_team_id']      # e.g., 5
   visitor_team_id = game['game']['visitor_team_id'] # e.g., 14
   player_team_id = game['team']['id']              # e.g., 5
   
   # Determine opponent
   if player_team_id == home_team_id:
       opponent_id = visitor_team_id  # Player home, opponent visitor
   else:
       opponent_id = home_team_id     # Player away, opponent home
   
   # Lookup abbreviation
   opponent = teams_lookup[opponent_id]  # "GSW"
   ```

3. **Cache Handling**:
   - Added warning when old cached data lacks team info
   - Provides "Clear Cache & Reload" button
   - Fetches fresh data with complete team information

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `nba_api.py` (lines 16, 25, 421-447)
- File: `app.py` (lines 66-90 for Season Report, 1138-1191 for Player Analysis)
- API endpoint: `/teams` (fetched once per session)
- Caching: Stored in `self._teams_cache` dictionary
- Performance: O(1) lookup, one-time API call

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Solves "vs N/A" display issue
- ✅ Centralized team data management
- ✅ Fast lookups with caching
- ✅ Works for both Season Report and Player Analysis
- ✅ Handles both fresh and cached data
- ✅ No repeated API calls for team data

**Impact:**
- ✅ Opponent tracking now works correctly
- ✅ Season Report shows actual team names
- ✅ Player Analysis filtering works with real teams
- ✅ Better user experience with accurate matchup data

### Removed Confidence Percentages from Simple View ✨ NEW (October 18, 2025)
**User Experience Improvement:**
- Removed potentially misleading "(XX% confidence)" text from simple prediction cards
- Simplified display for non-technical users

**What Changed:**
- **Before**: `❌ UNLIKELY (75% confidence)`
- **After**: `❌ UNLIKELY`

**Rationale:**
- "100% confidence" sounds like a guarantee (misleading)
- Percentages confuse non-technical users
- LIKELY/UNLIKELY is clearer and more actionable
- Focus on performance indicators (HOT/COLD) and betting recommendations

**Technical Implementation:**
- File: `components/simple_prediction_cards.py` (lines 115-119)
- Simple change: Removed `({regression_prob:.0%} confidence)` from markdown strings
- No impact on underlying calculations

**What Remains:**
- ✅ LIKELY/UNLIKELY prediction
- ✅ Performance indicators (🔥 HOT, ❄️ COLD, 📊 STEADY, ⚡ VOLATILE)
- ✅ Betting recommendations (OVER/UNDER/NEUTRAL/AVOID)
- ✅ Actionable insights in plain language

**Updated Display Format:**
```
🎯 Points ≥ 25
✅ LIKELY    🔥 HOT    💡 BET: OVER

💡 Strong recent performance - likely to exceed threshold
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Cleaner, less cluttered interface
- ✅ Avoids misleading language
- ✅ Better for casual/betting users
- ✅ Focus on actionable information
- ✅ Maintains all predictive power in background

## 🎯 Recent Enhancements

### Schema-Versioned Cache System (Implemented: October 20, 2025)

**Feature**: Complete cache rewrite with automatic schema validation and versioning

**Problem Solved**: Old cache stored incomplete game objects missing `home_team_id`/`visitor_team_id`, causing opponent filter failures.

**Implementation Details**:
- **New Module**: `cache_sqlite.py` - Standalone cache library
- **Schema Versioning**: `SCHEMA_VER = "games:v2"` - auto-invalidates on field changes
- **Required Fields**: `{id, date, home_team_id, visitor_team_id}` - validated before caching
- **TTL-Based Expiration**: 6 hours for games, 24 hours for teams
- **Deterministic Keys**: SHA256 hash of namespace + params + schema version
- **Auto-Recovery**: Schema mismatch triggers cache clear and refetch

**Database Structure**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE http_cache (
    key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- SHA256 hash
    payload TEXT NOT NULL,          -- JSON serialized
    updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,    -- Unix timestamp
    schema_ver TEXT NOT NULL        -- e.g., "games:v2"
)
```

**API Integration**:
- `nba_api.py` updated to use new cache for `get_recent_games()` and `get_all_teams_details()`
- Game normalization ensures all required fields present
- Validation before caching prevents incomplete data

**Cache Files**:
- `cache.db` - HTTP cache (NEW, schema-versioned)
- `nba_cache.db` - User data (favorites, predictions) - unchanged

**User Impact**:
- Opponent filter now works correctly (SAC, LAL, etc. all detected)
- Fresh data guaranteed to have team IDs
- Clear cache button in UI
- Debug mode shows loaded game data

**Formula/Assumptions**:
- No formula changes
- Assumption: All games from API v1 /stats endpoint include `home_team_id` and `visitor_team_id`
- Assumption: Schema version changes are infrequent (backward compatibility)

---

### Simplified Threshold Settings (Implemented: October 20, 2025)

**Feature**: Single threshold per stat category instead of 4 sliders

**User Feedback**: "4 thresholds per category is confusing - users only need 1"

**Implementation Details**:
- **Before**: 16 sliders total (4 per category: PTS 1, PTS 2, PTS 3, PTS 4)
- **After**: 4 number inputs total (1 per category)
- **UI**: 2-column layout with clear labels
- **Storage**: Still stores as arrays for code compatibility: `[20]` instead of `[10, 15, 20, 25]`

**Technical Changes**:
- `components/advanced_settings.py`: Replaced sliders with `st.number_input()`
- Default thresholds: PTS=20, REB=8, AST=6, 3PM=3
- Tooltips simplified to single-line examples

**Formula/Assumptions**:
- No formula changes
- Threshold now represents single betting line (e.g., "Over 25.5 points")
- Compatible with existing probability calculation model

**User Impact**:
- 75% fewer controls (16 → 4)
- Clearer intent: "What's the line I care about?"
- Matches sports betting interface patterns

   - Z-scores still calculated in background for normalization

2. **Removed Confidence Labels from Predictions**
   - Before: "68.5%  |  🟢 High confidence"
   - After: "68.5%"
   - Rationale: Misleading - based only on sample size, not actual reliability

3. **Simplified Fatigue Analysis Section**
   - Before: 2-column layout (Fatigue Curve + Minutes Trend)
   - After: Single "Minutes Played Analysis" section
   - Removed: Points fatigue curve, rolling averages, regression risk annotations
   - Kept: Minutes trend chart, sustainability metrics

**Technical Changes**:
- `app.py`: Lines 976-989 - Removed Z-score deltas from metrics
- `components/prediction_cards.py`: Lines 36-39 - Removed confidence indicator
- `app.py`: Lines 1066-1107 - Simplified fatigue section

**Formula/Assumptions**:

- Mean, median, std dev calculations
- Anomaly threshold: |x - μ| > 2σ

**User Impact**:
- Complete picture of shooting performance
- Can track hot/cold 3-point streaks
- Identifies exceptional shooting games

---

### Alpha Impact Visualizer (Implemented: October 20, 2025)

**Feature**: "Show α Impact" checkbox to compare weighted vs unweighted probabilities

**User Feedback**: "When I change alpha, it doesn't seem to change much"

**Implementation Details**:
- **UI Element**: Checkbox next to "Simple View" toggle
- **Display**: Table comparing:
  - Unweighted (α=1.00) - simple average
  - Weighted (α=current) - recency-weighted
  - Difference - shows alpha's actual effect
  - Impact indicator - 🔥 Hot / ❄️ Cold / ⚖️ Neutral

**Impact Thresholds**:
- < 3% difference: Low impact (consistent performance)
- 3-10% difference: Moderate impact (some trend)
- > 10% difference: High impact (strong recent trend)

**Technical Changes**:
- `app.py`: Lines 1457, 1460-1496 - Added impact comparison logic
- Shows both `frequency` and `weighted_frequency` from model results
- Calculates absolute differences and categorizes impact

**Formula**:
```
Impact = weighted_freq - unweighted_freq
weighted_freq = Σ(w[i] × exceeds[i]) where w[i] = α^(N-i-1) / Σ(α^j)
unweighted_freq = (1/N) × Σ(exceeds[i])
```

**Assumptions**:
- Large difference indicates recent performance differs from historical
- Users want to see if alpha adjustment is meaningful
- Educational tool to understand recency weighting

**User Impact**:
- Transparency about whether alpha matters for specific player
- Educational - shows how the model works
- Helps users decide optimal alpha setting

---

### Enhanced Tooltips with User-Friendly Explanations (Implemented: October 20, 2025)

  - Example-based: "Set to 25 → Predicts probability of scoring OVER 25 points"
  - No technical jargon

**Technical Details**:
- All tooltips use single-line format with pipe separators
- Removed multi-line explanations (browser compatibility issues)
- Removed position-based ranges (cluttered)

**User Impact**:
- Instant understanding without reading documentation
- Examples show real-world usage
- No technical knowledge required

---

### Opponent-Specific Analysis (Implemented: October 18, 2025)

**Feature**: Filter predictions based on performance vs specific opponent teams

**Implementation Details**:
- **Game Loading**: Changed from 20 games to ALL games from selected season (up to 100)
- **Opponent Search**: Autocomplete search by team name, city, or abbreviation
  - Example: Type "L" → Shows Lakers (LAL), Clippers (LAC)
  - Example: Type "Warriors" → Shows Golden State Warriors (GSW)
- **Filtering Logic**: Uses ALL games vs selected opponent from the season
  - If Stephen Curry 2024-2025 vs Lakers → finds all LAL games from 2024-2025
  - Typically 3-4 games per opponent per season
- **Sample Size Warnings**:
  - ⚠️ Warning if < 3 games
  - 🚨 Error if < 2 games
  - Recommends using general prediction for small samples

**Technical Changes**:
- `app.py`: Line 714, 616, 804 - Changed `limit=20` to `limit=100`
- `app.py`: Lines 1262-1282 - Removed "last 3 games" limit, uses ALL opponent games
- `nba_api.py`: Lines 449-461 - Added `get_all_teams_details()` method
- All predictions now based on full season data instead of recent subset

**User Impact**:
- More accurate opponent-specific predictions
