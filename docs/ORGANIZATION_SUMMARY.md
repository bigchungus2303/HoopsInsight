## 📊 Statistics

### Before Organization
- Root directory: ~30 files (messy)
- Documentation: Scattered in root
- Data files: Mixed with code

### After Organization  
- Root directory: ~15 core files (clean)
- Documentation: Centralized in `docs/`
- Data files: In `data/` folder
- **Result**: 50% reduction in root clutter

## 🔧 Code Updates

### Path Changes
All code updated to reference new paths:

1. **`services/picks.py`**:
   ```python
   schedule_path: str = "data/nba_2025_2026_schedule.csv"  # Updated
   config_path = Path("pick_configs/picks.yaml")  # Renamed from config/
   ```

2. **Documentation references updated in**:
   - `attached_assets/nba-stats-mvp.md`
   - `README.md`

---

## ⏳ Pending Actions

### When App is Stopped
Move the schedule file:
```powershell
move nba_2025_2026_schedule.csv data\
```

Then delete this file (it's already in data/ folder, just locked).

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root**: Only essential files visible
2. **Better Navigation**: Organized by purpose
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Find files quickly
4. **Professional**: Standard project structure
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new features
