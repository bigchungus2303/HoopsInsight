# Pick of the Day Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview

The **Pick of the Day** feature generates high-confidence predictions for upcoming NBA games. It selects the top 5 picks per team for each game, using the existing prediction engine and the season schedule CSV.

## Files Created

### Core Service
- **`services/picks.py`** (500+ lines) - Core business logic
  - `PickOfTheDayService` class with 8 core functions
  - `load_schedule_csv()` - Load schedule from CSV
  - `find_games_for_date()` - Find games for specific date
  - `select_player_pool()` - Select top K players (currently limited - see below)
  - `build_candidate_markets()` - Build stat+threshold combinations
  - `predict_probability()` - Generate probability predictions
  - `top_picks()` - Select top 5 with diversity constraints
  - `generate_team_picks()` - Generate picks for one team
  - `generate_game_picks()` - Generate picks for both teams in a game
  - `export_picks_csv()` - Export picks to CSV format
  - `export_picks_json()` - Export picks to JSON format

### Configuration
- **`pick_configs/picks.yaml`** (40 lines) - Market presets and filters
  - **Presets**: Default, Conservative, Aggressive
  - **Diversity rules**: Require distinct stats, minimum confidence gap
  - **Filters**: Minimum minutes, minimum samples

### UI Page
- **`pages/pick_of_the_day.py`** (350+ lines) - Streamlit interface
  - Sidebar controls (date, team filter, market preset, alpha, min samples, opponent filter)
  - Game cards with team picks
  - Pick cards with player, stat, threshold, probability, badges, rationale
  - Export functionality (CSV/JSON)

### Tests
- **`tests/test_picks.py`** (250+ lines) - Unit tests
  - Configuration loading
  - Schedule CSV parsing
  - Game finding (deterministic)
  - Candidate market building
  - Top picks diversity logic
  - Badge and rationale generation
  - Export functionality

### Integration
- **`app.py`** - Updated with navigation buttons
  - Added "🎯 Pick of the Day" button to all pages
  - Routed page display
  - Updated Quick Start Guide

### Dependencies
- **`requirements.txt`** - Added `pyyaml` for config parsing

## Schedule CSV Format

The feature uses `nba_2025_2026_schedule.csv` with the following columns:
- `month`, `gid`, `gcode`
- `game_date_local`, `tip_local_time`, `tip_et_time`
- `arena`, `city`, `state`
- `visitor_abbr`, `visitor_team`, `visitor_city`
- `home_abbr`, `home_team`, `home_city`
- `utc_date`, `utc_time`
- `broadcasters_tv`, `broadcasters_radio`, `broadcasters_ott`, `broadcasters_natltv`

## How It Works

### 1. Schedule Loading
```python
service = PickOfTheDayService(api_client)
games = service.find_games_for_date(datetime(2026, 1, 1))
```

### 2. Pick Generation Flow
```
For each game:
  ├─ Away Team
  │  ├─ Select player pool (top 8 by minutes/usage)
  │  ├─ Build candidate markets (preset thresholds)
  │  ├─ Predict probabilities (inverse-frequency model)
  │  ├─ Apply diversity constraints
  │  └─ Select top 5 picks
  │
  └─ Home Team
     └─ (same process)
```

### 3. Prediction Model
- Uses existing **Inverse-Frequency Model** with Bayesian smoothing
- **Opponent-aware filtering** (optional)
- **Alpha recency weighting** (0.5-1.0)
- **Minimum sample size** filtering (2-5 games)
- **Diversity constraints**: No duplicate player+stat unless >5% probability gap

### 4. Pick Card Format
```
🏀 LeBron James — Points ≥ 25
75.0%
HIGH CONFIDENCE

🔥 HOT ✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE

💡 Strong history vs GSW: exceeded 25 points in 8/10 recent games
📊 Based on 10 games | α=0.85
```

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Player Pool Selection - WORKING
**Solution**: Static roster of 3-4 star players per team with injury filtering

**How It Works**:
- Searches by first name only (API requirement)
- Filters to correct team after search
- **DNP Detection**: Excludes players with 0-5 minutes in last 3 games
- **Injury Patterns**: Filters out likely injured players based on:
  - All games <2 minutes (DNP)
  - All games <5 minutes (severe restriction)
  - Average <10 minutes in last 3 (bench/returning from injury)
- Results are cached for performance

**Injury Limitations**:
- ⚠️ **Offseason injuries**: Won't detect until new season games played
- ✅ **In-season injuries**: Detected after 1-3 DNPs
- ✅ **Load management**: Filtered if consistent low minutes

**Example Output (Oct 21, 2025)**:
- HOU: Alperen Sengun (2 picks ≥77%) - Fred VanVleet filtered out if injured
- OKC: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2 picks ≥77%)
- Only shows high-confidence predictions from available players!

## API Usage (For Developers)

### Programmatic Access
```python
from services.picks import PickOfTheDayService
from nba_api import NBAAPIClient
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize
api_client = NBAAPIClient()
service = PickOfTheDayService(api_client)

# Find today's games
today = datetime.now()
games = service.find_games_for_date(today)

# Generate picks
game_picks = service.generate_game_picks(
    games[0],
    preset='default',  # or 'conservative' or 'aggressive'
    alpha=0.85,
    min_samples=3,
    season=2024,
    use_opponent_filter=True
)

# Access picks
for pick in game_picks['away_picks']:
    print(f"{pick['player_name']}: {pick['stat']} >= {pick['threshold']} - {pick['probability']*100:.1f}%")
```

### In the Streamlit App
1. Launch app: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Click "🎯 Pick of the Day" in sidebar
3. Picks automatically load for today's games
4. View high-confidence predictions (≥77%)
5. Optional: Export to CSV or JSON

**Note**: All settings are automatic - no configuration needed!

## Configuration

### Market Presets (`pick_configs/picks.yaml`)
```yaml
presets:
  default:
    pts: [20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
    ast: [5, 7, 10, 12, 15]
    reb: [6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
    fg3m: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  
  conservative:
    pts: [15, 20, 25, 30]
    # Lower thresholds for higher probability
  
  aggressive:
    pts: [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]
    # Higher thresholds for more risk
```

### Diversity Rules
```yaml
diversity:
  require_distinct_stats: true  # Prefer variety in stat types
  min_conf_gap_for_duplicate_stat: 0.05  # 5% probability gap
```

```yaml
filters:
  min_minutes_last5: 18  # Exclude players with <18 mpg
  exclude_small_sample_under: 2  # Require ≥2 games
```

## Integration with Existing Features

The Pick of the Day feature reuses existing infrastructure:
- ✅ **NBAAPIClient** - API access and caching
- ✅ **InverseFrequencyModel** - Probability calculations
- ✅ **StatisticsEngine** - Statistical analysis
- ✅ **Opponent filtering** - Team-specific predictions
- ✅ **Alpha weighting** - Recency weighting
- ✅ **Bayesian smoothing** - Small sample handling
- ✅ **SQLite caching** - Performance optimization

No new external services added!

## Deterministic Behavior

Given fixed inputs, the system produces identical outputs:
- Same date → Same games (from CSV)
- Same alpha → Same recency weights
- Same min_samples → Same filtering
- Same preset → Same thresholds
- Same player data → Same probabilities

## Next Steps

To make the feature fully functional:

1. **Implement Player Pool** (highest priority)
   - Add team roster data source
   - Update `select_player_pool()` to fetch players
   - Or manually search for top players per team

2. **Enhanced Features** (optional)
   - Add player injury data
   - Add matchup difficulty ratings
   - Add vegas line integration
   - Add historical accuracy tracking

3. **Performance** (optional)
   - Cache player pool by team
   - Parallelize pick generation
   - Pre-compute for upcoming games

## Documentation Updates

Updated files:
- ✅ `attached_assets/nba-stats-mvp.md` - Add Pick of the Day to feature list
- ✅ `app.py` - Quick Start Guide updated
- ✅ `PICK_OF_THE_DAY_README.md` - This file (comprehensive guide)
