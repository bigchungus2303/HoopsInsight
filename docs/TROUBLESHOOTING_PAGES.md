# Page Navigation Troubleshooting Guide

## ✅ Fix Applied: October 18, 2025

### Issue
When clicking "Season Report" or "Prediction History", nothing showed up.

### Root Cause
The page routing logic was placed in the wrong location in the code flow.

### Fix Applied
Moved routing logic to execute AFTER sidebar is defined, so:
1. Sidebar renders (available on all pages)
2. Routing logic checks current_page
3. Appropriate page displays
4. st.stop() prevents Player Analysis from showing

## 🧪 How to Test

### **Step 1: Start the App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Step 2: Test Each Page**

#### **Test Player Analysis (Default)**
1. App should load normally
2. See: "👈 Search and select a player from the sidebar"
3. Sidebar shows player search
4. ✅ Working if you see this

#### **Test Prediction History**
1. Click dropdown in top-right → Select "Prediction History"
2. Should see: "📊 Prediction History & Model Performance"
3. Should see tabs: "📈 Accuracy Metrics" | "📋 Recent Predictions" | "✅ Verify"
4. Should see: "📭 No predictions have been made yet..." message
5. ✅ Working if you see this

#### **Test Season Report**
1. Click dropdown → Select "Season Report"
2. Should see: "📅 Season Performance Report"
3. Should see: "👈 Please select a player from the sidebar to view season report"
4. Should see feature list
5. ✅ Working if you see this

### **Step 3: Test with Player Loaded**
1. Go back to "Player Analysis"
2. Load a player (e.g., "LeBron")
3. Switch to "Season Report"
4. Should see player name and filtering options
5. ✅ Working if you see stats and charts

## 🐛 If Pages Still Don't Show

### **Check 1: Console Errors**
Open browser console (F12) and check for JavaScript errors.

### **Check 2: Streamlit Errors**
Look at the terminal where you ran `streamlit run app.py` for Python errors.

### **Check 3: Verify Routing**
Add this temporary debug at line 350 in app.py:
```python
st.write(f"DEBUG: Current page is '{current_page}'")  # Remove after testing
```

### **Check 4: Import Errors**
If you see errors like "ModuleNotFoundError", run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Expected Behavior

### **Navigation Flow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ NBA Player Performance Predictor        │
│ [Player Analysis ▼] Select page here   │
│ ─────────────────────────────────────   │
│                                         │
│ [Sidebar]        [Main Content]        │
│ - Player Search  - Shows selected page │
│ - API Dashboard  - Different for each  │
│ - Settings       - Player Analysis     │
│ - Comparison     - Season Report       │
│                  - Prediction History  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **When you select a page:**
1. Dropdown value changes
2. `st.session_state.current_page` updates
3. `st.rerun()` triggers
4. Page re-renders with new routing
5. Appropriate page function is called
6. `st.stop()` prevents other pages from rendering
