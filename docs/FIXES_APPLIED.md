# Fixes Applied - October 18, 2025

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### **Issue 1: Page Navigation Not Working**
**Problem:** Clicking "Season Report" or "Prediction History" showed nothing.

**Root Cause:** Routing logic was in wrong location.

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved routing logic to execute BEFORE player analysis content
- Each page now has its own custom sidebar
- Added `st.stop()` to prevent multiple pages from rendering
- Added error handling with traceback display

---

### **Issue 2: Messy Prediction Cards UI**
**Problem:** Too many visual elements (progress bars, duplicate text).

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed progress bars (`st.progress()`)
- Removed duplicate "Probability: X%" text
- Removed extra confidence caption
- Result: Clean, simple metric cards only

**Before:**
```
≥ 20 points
65.3%
Confidence: High (15 games)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 65%
🟢 Confidence level: High
```

**After:**
```
≥ 20 points
65.3%
🟢 High confidence
```

### **Issue 3: Season Report with Unnecessary Prediction Settings**
**Problem:** Season Report showed all Player Analysis sidebar settings.

**Fix Applied:**
- Each page now has custom sidebar
- **Season Report Sidebar:**
  - Player name (if loaded)
  - Back button to Player Analysis
  - Minimal API status
- **Prediction History Sidebar:**
  - Simple header
  - Minimal API status
- **Player Analysis Sidebar:**
  - Full search and settings (unchanged)

---

### **Issue 4: Date Range Picker Bug**
**Problem:** Start date only showed 2024, end date only showed 2025.

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed date range constraints
- `start_date`: Can select any date in season range
- `end_date`: min_value set to `start_date` (must be after start)
- Added format: "YYYY-MM-DD" for clarity
