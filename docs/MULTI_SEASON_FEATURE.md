# Multi-Season Smart Loading Feature

## ✅ Implemented: October 21, 2025

## 🎯 Purpose

Automatically supplement new season data with previous season games during season transitions to ensure meaningful analysis.

---

## 💡 The Problem

**Scenario**: October 22, 2025 - First game of 2025-2026 season

**Without this feature**:
- User selects "2025-2026 season" for Stephen Curry
- Only 1 game available → Insufficient for analysis
- Predictions unreliable with tiny sample size
- Poor user experience

**With this feature**:
- Automatically fetches 1 game from 2025-2026
- Supplements with 99 games from 2024-2025
- Total: 100 games for robust analysis
- Clear indicator showing data mix

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### New Function: `get_recent_games_smart()`

**Location**: `nba_api.py` (lines 273-326)

**Signature**:
```python
def get_recent_games_smart(
    player_id: int, 
    limit: int = 100,
    season: int = None,
    postseason: bool = False,
    min_games_threshold: int = 10
) -> tuple[List[Dict], Dict]:
```

**Logic**:
1. Fetch games from selected season
2. If games < `min_games_threshold` (default: 10):
   - Fetch games from previous season
   - Combine both seasons
   - Sort by date (most recent first)
   - Limit to requested amount
3. Return games + metadata

**Metadata Returned**:
```python
{
    'current_season_games': 1,      # Games from 2025-2026
    'prev_season_games': 71,        # Games from 2024-2025
    'total_games': 72,              # Combined total
    'seasons_used': [2025, 2024],   # Seasons included
    'supplemented': True            # Whether supplementation occurred
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Threshold: 10 Games
- **Rationale**: 10 games is minimum for reliable statistical analysis
- **Bayesian smoothing** already applied for <10 games
- **Balance**: Not too aggressive, not too conservative

### Configurable
Can adjust threshold per use case:
- Player pool (Pick of the Day): `min_games_threshold=3`
- Main analysis: `min_games_threshold=10`
- Season report: `min_games_threshold=10`

---

## 📈 Benefits

1. ✅ **Smooth Season Transition**: No data gaps during season start
2. ✅ **Always Enough Data**: Minimum 10 games for analysis
3. ✅ **Most Recent Form**: Sorted by date, newest first
4. ✅ **Transparent**: Clear messaging about data sources
5. ✅ **Automatic**: No user configuration needed
6. ✅ **Deterministic**: Same logic every time

## 📝 Formula/Assumptions

**Supplementation Logic**:
```python
if current_season_games < 10:
    combined_games = current_season_games + previous_season_games
    combined_games.sort(by_date, reverse=True)  # Most recent first
    return combined_games[:100]
```

**Assumptions**:
- 10 games minimum for reliable analysis
- Most recent games most relevant (sorted by date)
- Previous season data still representative
- Users want analysis to work immediately

---

## 🏥 Injury Detection Integration

### Combined with DNP Filtering

The multi-season feature works alongside injury detection:

1. **Early Season** (0-9 games in new season):
   - Loads previous season data
   - DNP filter checks last 3 games from previous season
   - Catches players who were injured at end of previous season

2. **Offseason Injuries**:
   - ⚠️ **Limitation**: Won't detect injuries between seasons
   - Players injured in offseason show as "available" until new season starts
   - **Mitigation**: UI warning to verify player status
   - **Resolution**: Auto-detected after 1-3 DNPs in new season

3. **Mid-Season** (10+ games):
   - Uses current season data only
   - DNP filter active on most recent games
   - Real-time injury detection based on game participation

### Example: Fred VanVleet

**Scenario**: Torn ACL during offseason (Sept 2025)

- **Oct 21, 2025** (Pre-season): 
  - Last 3 games from 2024: 27, 36, 37 minutes → Shows as available ⚠️
  - **Issue**: Offseason injury not detected
  
- **Oct 22-24, 2025** (First 3 games of 2025):
  - Games 1-3: 0, 0, 0 minutes (DNP)
  - **Detection**: Auto-filtered out ✅
  - **Status**: Will not appear in picks

**Recommendation**: Users should verify injury reports for critical picks, especially early in new season.
