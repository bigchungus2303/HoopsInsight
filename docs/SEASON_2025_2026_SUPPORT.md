## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Added 2025-2026 Season to All Selectors

**Files Modified**: `app.py`

**Changes**:
- Main player selector: `range(2025, 2019, -1)` (was 2024-2019)
- Favorites selector: Added 2025-2026 option
- Comparison selector: Added 2025-2026 option  
- Season Report selector: Added 2025-2026 option

**Lines**: 895, 817, 1006, 615

### 2. Fixed "Next Game Predictions" Section

**Problem**: 
- Condition was: `if recent_games and season_stats:`
- For 2025-2026: recent_games ✅ (from smart loading), season_stats ❌ (None)
- **Result**: Predictions section didn't show!

**Fix**:
- Changed to: `if recent_games:` (only require games)
- Season stats are optional (only needed for career phase)
- **Line**: 1373

**Impact**:
- ✅ Predictions now show for 2025-2026 season
- ✅ Uses smart-loaded games from 2024-2025
- ✅ Tomorrow will use 1 new + 99 old games

### 3. Graceful Career Phase Handling

**Problem**: Career phase requires season stats (not available for 2025 yet)

**Fix**:
```python
if use_career_phase and not season_stats:
    st.info("Career Phase Decay disabled: Season statistics not available...")
    use_career_phase = False
```

**Lines**: 1560-1562

**Impact**:
- ✅ Automatically disables career phase for new seasons
- ✅ Shows clear message to user
- ✅ Falls back to standard prediction model

## 📝 Formula/Assumptions

**Assumption**: Recent games from previous season are representative for early predictions

**Rationale**:
- Player ability doesn't change overnight
- Recent form (end of 2024-2025) → Good proxy for start of 2025-2026
- Better to have predictions based on 50 games than nothing
- Updates automatically as new season progresses

**Bayesian Smoothing**: Still applies for small samples, providing conservative estimates
