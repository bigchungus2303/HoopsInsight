# Prediction History Feature - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed: October 18, 2025

### Overview
Successfully implemented a complete prediction tracking system that allows users to save predictions, verify them after games, and track model accuracy over time. **Backend was already 100% complete** - this implementation added the frontend UI.

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

### **1. Prediction History Page** (`pages/prediction_history.py`)
A comprehensive page with three tabs:

#### **Tab 1: Accuracy Metrics Dashboard**
- Overall accuracy percentage (Total, Correct, Accuracy %)
- Breakdown by stat category:
  - 🏀 Points
  - 💪 Rebounds
  - 🎯 Assists
  - 🎯 3-Pointers
- Visual progress bars for each category
- Detailed breakdown by threshold ranges (low/medium/high)
- Export-ready data format

#### **Tab 2: Recent Predictions**
- Filterable list of all saved predictions
- Show verified/unverified status
- Display columns:
  - Player name
  - Game date
  - Stat type
  - Threshold value
  - Predicted probability
  - Confidence level
  - Status (⏳ Pending | ✅ Correct | ❌ Incorrect)
  - Actual value (for verified)
- Filter options:
  - Show verified only
  - Number to display (10/20/50/100)

#### **Tab 3: Verification Interface**
- Lists all unverified predictions (past game date)
- Shows prediction details:
  - Player name
  - Game date
  - Stat type and threshold
  - Predicted probability
  - Confidence level
- Simple number input for actual result
- One-click verify button
- Automatic correctness calculation
- Real-time accuracy metric updates

---

### **2. Save Predictions UI** (in `app.py`)
Added to the "🔮 Next Game Predictions" section:

**Features:**
- Collapsible expander: "📝 Save These Predictions"
- Date picker for next game (defaults to tomorrow)
- Checkbox selection for each prediction:
  - Organized by stat type
  - Shows threshold and probability
  - Multiple selections allowed
- Individual save buttons for each selected prediction
- Success/error feedback
- Guidance to visit Prediction History after saving

---

### **3. Page Navigation** (in `app.py`)
- Dropdown selector in top-right corner
- Options: "Player Analysis" | "Prediction History"
- Seamless page switching
- Preserves session state
- Clean routing logic with `st.stop()`

---

## 📊 User Workflow

### **Step 1: Save Predictions**
1. View a player's analysis
2. Scroll to "🔮 Next Game Predictions"
3. Open "📝 Save These Predictions" expander
4. Select game date
5. Check predictions you want to track
6. Click individual "💾 Save" buttons
7. See confirmation: "✅ Saved! (ID: X)"

### **Step 2: After the Game**
1. Switch to "Prediction History" page
2. Go to "✅ Verify Predictions" tab
3. See list of unverified predictions
4. Enter actual game result (e.g., "28.0" for 28 points)
5. Click "✅ Verify"
6. See if prediction was correct/incorrect

### **Step 3: Track Performance**
1. Go to "📈 Accuracy Metrics" tab
2. View overall accuracy
3. See breakdown by stat category
4. Monitor improvement over time
